<h3 class="text-center">Helpful to a Fault</h3>
<p>Clippit is a virtual assistant whose visibility made him the face of Microsoft Office products at the turn of the millenium.  "Clippy", as he was affectionately known, would pop up (literally) when an Office user began a document in a certain format, offering a template to speed up the process.  Writing letters was his passion, though he also excelled (pun intended) at software installation and envelope formatting.</p>

<p>In his heyday, Clippy assisted with the following programs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Office for Windows (98-2003)</li>
  <li>Microsoft Publisher (98-2003)</li>
  <li>Microsoft Office for Mac (98-2004)</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-center">Retirement and Reappearance</h3>
<p>When Clippy was supplanted by newer, less enthusiastic virtual assistants in 2001, his retirement was thought to be permanent.  For most of that decade, it seemed that he would only live on in parody videos and meme generators.  However, after a number of cameo appearances in other sofware, and starring in a 2011 tutorial game, Clippy quietly rejoined Microsoft Office in the online and 2016 editions. (It was agreed that he was best suited to an inconspicuous role, particularly after his recent appearance on the Tonight Show.)
<p>While Clippy may never regain his past fame (or infamy), he will never be forgotten.</p>
