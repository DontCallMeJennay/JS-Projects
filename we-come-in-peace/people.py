#locals: Randomly encountered people
#leaders: World leaders whom you must impress to advance
#gifts: Possible gifts the leaders will give you. Not sure what purpose they serve yet.

#For the record, the countries and locations were chosen for no other reason than variety, and the locals 
#and their gifts are just off the top of my head. I hope none of the jokes or stereotypes  
#here are harmful.
