# JS-Projects
freeCodeCamp assignments and other JavaScript/jQuery projects.

Update 2/26/17: After a long hiatus from CodePen, I went back and found that many of my old projects were "broken" due to browser changes and cross-origin issues. They're all hosted on my personal website now, but I also had to make the source code reviewable somehow. Hence today's big commit.
